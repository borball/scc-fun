# **Fun with SCCs**

This repository has some demo labs to help you understand how different SCC subsystems work.

It's highly recommended reviewing the following blogs in order to understand the concepts used in the labs:

* [Container Security - Linux Capabilities and Secure Compute Profiles](https://linuxera.org/container-security-capabilities-seccomp/)
* [Capabilities and Seccomp Profiles on Kubernetes](https://linuxera.org/capabilities-seccomp-kubernetes/)
